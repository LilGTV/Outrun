Outrun is a fast-paced 3D action demo built in Unreal Engine as part of a bachelor’s thesis project. The game challenges players to eliminate enemies in enclosed arenas while relying on precision, quick decision-making, and strategic use of abilities.

The gameplay is centered around fluid mobility. Players can dash to evade danger, chain double jumps to gain advantageous positions, and maintain constant momentum throughout combat. These mechanics create a sense of agility and responsiveness that keeps encounters dynamic and engaging.

Combat blends melee and ranged options, requiring players to adapt their approach depending on enemy type. Sword-wielding opponents pose an immediate close-range threat, while ranged shooters attempt to hinder the player’s movement from afar. To counter these challenges, the player can activate a temporary slow-motion mode, shifting the flow of battle and opening tactical opportunities.

- **W, A, S, D** -> Move
- **Hold Shift** -> Sprint
- **Space** -> Jump/Double Jump
- **Q** -> Dash (takes one second to recharge before it can be used again; can dash on ground and in air)
- **X** -> Slo-Mo (slow down time for a few seconds; you move at the same speed while everyone else is considerably slowed down)
- **Right Mouse Button** -> Sword attack (kills enemies)
- **Left Mouse Button** -> Gun attack (slows down enemies)
- Enemies can only be eliminated via melee (sword) attacks, ranged (gun) attacks only slow them down for a second, allowing you to reposition yourself
- Gunner enemies can only be eliminated while in Slo-Mo mode, they also cannot be stunned
